# Django-with-Multiple-databases
The first step to using more than one database with Django is to tell Django about the database servers youâ€™ll be using. 
This is done using the DATABASES setting. This setting maps database aliases, which are a way to refer to a specific database throughout Django, to a dictionary of settings for that specific connection. The settings in the inner dictionaries are described fully in the DATABASES documentation.
